‚óè  	Reflect on the following questions in your readme file
What did you like about this project?
It's really challenging. I know before this JavaScript Assessment that I am still learning, and it takes time. But it's scary that I don't really know how to think like a programmer yet.
What did you struggle with in this project?
Understanding the logic behind certain functions. I require the help of the internet to input some functions and understanding how these functions work.
What would make your experience with this assessment better?
I just got to understand the logic flow, and train myself to come up with my own logical functions. I understand this JS Assessment is very challenging for someone new like me. But I just feel bad not being able to fully understand.
